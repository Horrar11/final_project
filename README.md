<h1>LKBFCW's RPG</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Terminal RPG, where you play to try to get to a higher floor; I spent most of my time cleaning up Anton's code so I couldn't get much extra features in</p><br>
<h2>Working Features (Testable stuff):</h2>
<p>Movement of the player and enemies - does not interfear with anything, meaning it cannot destory terrain, or delete enemies by walking on them etc.</p><br>
<p>Going up stairs</p><br>
<h2>Unresolved Bugs:</h2>
<p>Sometimes when running the old file, it would crash randomly when moving; I think it happens when two enemy try to walk on each other, but that shouldn't happen anymore </p><br>
<h2>How to Compile:</h2>
<p>javac RPG.java</p><br>
<h2>Directions how to use program:</h2>
